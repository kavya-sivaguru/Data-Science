# Problem:

Restaurants from all over the world can be found here in Bengaluru. From the United States 
to Japan, Russia to Antarctica, you get all types of cuisines here. Delivery, Dine-out, Pubs, 
Bars, Drinks, Buffet, Desserts you name it and Bengaluru has it. Bengaluru is the best place 
for foodies. The number of restaurants is increasing day by day. Currently, it stands at 
approximately 12,000 restaurants. With such a high number of restaurants. This industry 
hasn't been saturated yet. And new restaurants are opening every day. However, it has 
become difficult for them to compete with already established restaurants. The key issues 
that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, 
shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain, and over-licensing. 

# Objective:
The newly started companies are not able to decide the cost that would happen per 
two people for once. So the Zomato company has a good analyst team who can predict the 
cost per two customers for one time so that the newly started restaurants and upcoming 
restaurants will be well prepared how the restaurant should invest in improving the 
ambiance and all other stuff to attract the customers. Assume you are the analyst team that 
Zomato has organized to help new and upcoming restaurants by letting them know the 
various reasons that customers look for and build a model which able to predict the cost for 
two people.
